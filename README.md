Emscripten Fork
===============

This is a fork of Eclipse CL with an attempt to get it working on emscripten.
Currently it does not work, but will make it through a lot of bootstrapping.

To build, just make sure emcc is setup in your path, change to the "c"
directory and run foo.sh


Eclipse Common Lisp
===================

Eclipse Common Lisp is an ANSI Common Lisp written by Howard Stearns
while at Elwood Corp.

(This system is unrelated to the eclipse Java IDE)

Eclipse Common Lisp is a Lisp interpreter written in C and Lisp.  It
is also capable of compiling Lisp to C and linking it into the eclipse
system.

Ultimately, Eclipse Common Lisp will be portable to 32 & 64 bit Linux,
Mac, and Windows.

See README2.txt for further instructions.
